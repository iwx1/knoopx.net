# About

Hello, I'm Víctor Martínez, a <%= age(Date.civil(1985, 12, 29)) %> years old ruby hacker from Barcelona, Spain.

<%= thumb "me.jpg", :resize => "400x400", :class => "right polaroid" %>

I'm a perfectionist and a constantly learning autodidact. I breathe technology in my daily job and in my spare time as part of my most passionate hobby.

I consider myself as good frontend as backend developer. My finest skill is the ability to research, learn and implement the proper technology on each particular case. 
When writing code I try to proactively diagnose future problems and try to solve them before they occur.

I enjoy working on small development teams and to teach and learn from everyone involved. I'm fascinated about other people's work, thoughts and ways of accomplishing things which I usually follow through their [blogs](http://www.google.com/reader/bundle/user/00328701256777536900/bundle/Programming), [GitHub](http://github.com/knoopx/) and [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/62368/knoopx). I have a sensible commitment to Open Source. I publish [my own personal projects](http://github.com/knoopx) and whenever I can, I report issues, try to fix them and contribute back.
