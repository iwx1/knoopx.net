----
A playground application I developed for playing with [d3.js]([http://mbostock.github.com/d3/) visualizations.
It fetches station information from the official iPhone application API endpoint on a minute basis and shows statistics not provided by official [Bicing](http://www.bicing.cat/) service

The live version can be accessed [here](http://bicing.knoopx.net/). Source code is publicly available in [GitHub](https://github.com/knoopx/bicing_stats). Feel free to fork it and send pull requests!
